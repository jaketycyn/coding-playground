# What's This All About?

This is a Next.js application built with TypeScript where I showcase my problem-solving approaches to common coding challenges (primarily leetcode), algorithms & simple tools. I created this project after realizing I was investing significant time in self-teaching but had no central place to showcase my work and growth. Each solution comes with detailed commentary explaining the thought process, what I've learned, remarks in regards to previous solutions & knowledge, time complexity analysis, and alternative approaches considered when applicable. While this is primarly a web diary for myself, I'm open to suggestions and improvements especially if theres ways to make this usable for others. Feel free to open an issue if you spot any bugs, submit a PR if you have an improvement in mind, or share alternative solutions to problems.
